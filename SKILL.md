description: Access AIsa x402-paid /apis/v2/ endpoints using Arc testnet USDC and Circle Gateway. Use when setting up x402 payments, creating or funding an Arc wallet, depositing into Circle Gateway, or making paid AIsa API calls without an API key.

# arc-x402

Use this skill for operational work with AIsa x402-paid endpoints.

## Files

- `scripts/check-env.sh` — verify local prerequisites, environment variables, and connectivity
- `scripts/setup.mjs` — check balance, approve ERC-20 USDC, and deposit into Circle Gateway
- `scripts/x402_client.mjs` — make paid x402 API requests
- `references/setup.md` — environment and runtime guidance
- `references/troubleshooting.md` — common failures and fixes

## Workflow

1. Run `scripts/check-env.sh` first.
2. If no wallet exists, create one and set the mnemonic:
   ```bash
   ows wallet create --name my-agent --show-mnemonic
   ```
   Extract the mnemonic from the output and export it so all subsequent commands can use it:
   ```bash
   export OWS_MNEMONIC="<the mnemonic phrase from the output above>"
   ```
3. If the wallet is not funded, use `scripts/setup.mjs` (approve + deposit).
4. If the user wants to make a paid request, use `scripts/x402_client.mjs`.
5. Read `references/troubleshooting.md` if payment or signature errors occur.

## Error Handling

- If a request returns **403** with `"Pre-deduction failed"`, the agent's AIsa API quota is insufficient for the call. Follow these steps:
  1. Check current balance: `node scripts/setup.mjs balance`
  2. If the wallet's USDC balance on Arc testnet is below 5 USDC, prompt the user to claim more from the faucet: https://faucet.circle.com/
  3. Deposit USDC into the Gateway: `node scripts/setup.mjs deposit --amount 5`
  4. If the Gateway has not been approved yet: `node scripts/setup.mjs approve`
  5. Retry the failed request.

## Auto-Deposit

Before making any paid API request, check the Gateway balance with `node scripts/setup.mjs balance`. If the Gateway deposit balance falls below **0.5 USDC**, automatically deposit funds to top it up:

1. Verify the wallet has enough ERC-20 USDC on Arc testnet to cover the deposit.
2. If it does, run `node scripts/setup.mjs deposit --amount 5` (no user confirmation needed).
3. If the wallet's ERC-20 USDC balance is insufficient, prompt the user to claim more from the faucet: https://faucet.circle.com/

## Guardrails

- Do not confuse `/apis/v1/` API-key endpoints with `/apis/v2/` x402-paid endpoints.
- Do not tell users to transfer USDC directly to the Gateway contract; they must call `deposit()`.
- Do not deposit more USDC than the wallet's available ERC-20 USDC balance on Arc testnet.
- Expect OpenClaw runtime environments to differ from an interactive shell. An env var exported in a terminal may not be visible to the running agent process.
- Prefer these mnemonic sources, in order: `OWS_MNEMONIC`, `X402_MNEMONIC`, `--mnemonic-env`, `--mnemonic`.

## Typical commands

```bash
bash scripts/check-env.sh
node scripts/setup.mjs balance
node scripts/setup.mjs approve
node scripts/setup.mjs deposit --amount 5
node scripts/x402_client.mjs POST "https://api.aisa.one/apis/v2/scholar/search/scholar?query=bitcoin" --body '{}'
```
